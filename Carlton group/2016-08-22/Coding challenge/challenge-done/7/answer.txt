7.	How would you best handle a situation where multiple administrators
are making changes to the organizational structure at the same time?


Answer:
    - Each administrator must be logged in to the system with own credentials before changing anything.
        This allows to place a mark on who changed what.
    - Some extra user roles could be introduced, because sometimes administrators have data access levels set to them as well.
        This allows to deny and/or allow access to sensitive information management for particular subgroups.
    - Transactions must be used in code in order to protect data integrity.
    - Suspicious actions could be logged if needed.
