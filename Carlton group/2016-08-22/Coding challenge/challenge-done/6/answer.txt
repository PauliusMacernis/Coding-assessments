6.	Acme requires that certain processes take place when a new department is created and when a department
is being removed or shifted to a new location. Describe what you would consider the best implementation to
effectively handle this requirement.


Answer:

    At first, I would consider having all requirements in one place. Have been using JIRA for issue management, but
    there are much more tools available: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems


    From the perspective of the development job that needs to be done:

    Changing the behaviour is not a problem at all. Especially, if any PHP framework is being used.
    It is most likely about changing the action code of the controller.

    However, sometimes development inside a database should be made instead of PHP code. For example,
    triggers, functions, procedures may be added.

    It really depends on what Acme wants to be done: Sending emails? Running shell scripts inside their web server?
    Calling remote web service? Sending messages? Calling somebody? Making lamps in the office flashing? All is possible.
